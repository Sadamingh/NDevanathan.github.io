Below is a preview of our week-by-week plan for the entire quarter. There may be slight adjustments and rearrangements as we go. The schedule for the final project is set and will not change.

In the readings below, K&R refers to Kernighan and Ritchie's classic text _The C Programming Language_ (accessible via Stanford's subscription to [Safari Books Online](https://proquest-safaribooksonline-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/9780133086249)). Nick Parlante's [EssentialC](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101) is another great C reference. Please do the recommended readings before lecture for best effect!
