### Welcome to the {{ site.data.quarter.name }} offering of CS107E!

CS107E is __Computer Systems from the Ground Up__. You can read [a summary of the course, its material, and history](/about/)
or a [discussion on its similarities and differences with CS107](http://cs107e.stanford.edu).

To take CS107E in the Fall of 2020, you must [pre-apply with this form](https://forms.gle/SwzXd6LcmHq65HSx6).
Please complete this form by 11:59PM PDT on September 1, 2020, if you would like to take the course. We will send out 
notifications of who is accepted into the course by September 4th. We require this early approval process because
we have to send Raspberry Pi kits to everyone and have them arrive before the quarter starts.

CS107E will be taught entirely remotely. Based on our experiences with what succeeded in Spring quarter, labs are 
groups of 10 or so students who are randomly grouped into breakouts of 2-3 students. As the quarter progresses,
students can start to request lab partners for the breakouts.

#### Announcements
{% comment %} Removed after first week
- Please read the [FAQ](http://cs107e.stanford.edu) for answers to common questions about the course. We expect to have more interested students than capacity. To be considered, you must attend the first lecture and submit the interest questionnaire.
-Our class discussion form is hosted on [Piazza]({{ site.data.quarter.forum }}). We will post all announcements on Piazza and you can ask and answer questions there.
