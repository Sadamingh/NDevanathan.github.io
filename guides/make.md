### What is a Makefile?

Make is a tool that automates building programs;
a Makefile describes the commands and options used in the build
process. As you will see soon enough, using a Makefile saves you a lot of retyping and makes your life
as a developer a whole lot smoother!

This guide introduces Makefiles using examples of cross-development for the ARM architecture. For further information about Makefiles in general,
check out the [other resources](#resources) on the bottom of this page.

### An example Makefile
The example makefile below builds the `blink.bin` program out of the `blink.c` source file.
Our labs and assignments will include similar Makefiles, 
so you will soon become familiar with the common structure.

```
    NAME = blink

    CFLAGS = -g -Wall -Og -std=c99 -ffreestanding
    LDFLAGS = -nostdlib

    all: $(NAME).bin
     
    %.bin: %.elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy $< -O binary $@

    %.elf: %.o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

    %.o: %.c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
    
    %.list: %.o
        arm-none-eabi-objdump -d $< > $@

    install: $(NAME).bin
        rpi-install.py $<

    clean:
        rm -f *.o *.elf *.bin *.list
```

This Makefile may look a bit cryptic at first! Let's try breaking it down step by step.

### Rules and recipes

In lecture, Pat whipped up a simple [doit script](/lectures/ASM/code/blink/doit) to automate retyping the commands to rebuild a program. The `make` tool is just a fancier version of doit. A `Makefile` is a text file that describes the steps needed to build a program.
Here is an example of a very simple hard-coded Makefile containing three targets `all`, `button.bin` and `clean`:
    
    all: button.bin

    button.bin: button.c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc -Og -g -Wall -std=c99 -ffreestanding -c button.c -o button.o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc -nostdlib button.o -o button.elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy button.elf -O binary button.bin
    
    clean: 
        rm -f *.bin *.o

__Rules__ are written in the following way: "the __dependencies__ on the right-hand-side are required
to make the __target__ on the left-hand-side." Thus the first line
indicates that `button.bin` is required to make `all`. In other words, to make `all`, we must first make `button.bin`.
    
    all: button.bin

This brings us to the next rule for `button.bin`:

    button.bin: button.c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc -Og -g -Wall -std=c99 -ffreestanding -c button.c -o button.o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc -nostdlib button.o -o button.elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy button.elf -O binary button.bin

The ingredients (dependencies on the right-hand-side) are needed as the starting point to create the desired output (target on the left-hand-side). The indented lines that follow the rule are the commands that turn the ingredients into the final product. These steps are collectively called the __recipe__. Thus, in order to make `button.bin`, we start with our ingredient (`button.c`) and then step through the commands in the recipe.

We could add a comment to explain the additional flags included when invoking the compiler. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.

    # Compiler flags used:
    #  -std=c99        use the c99 standard
    #  -Og             generate optimized code designed for debugging
    #  -g              add debugging information
    #  -Wall           give warnings about *all* issues
    #  -ffreestanding  generate code assuming no operating system

The final rule indicates what should happen when we `make clean`; the recipe for the clean target removes any previous build products so the next compile starts fresh.

    clean: 
        rm -f *.bin *.o

One particularly nifty thing `make` is that only rebuilds a target when one or more of the components it depends on has changed.  If you attempt to re-build a target which is already up-to-date, `make` will tell you:

    $ make
    make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

### Macros

After repeatedly copy-pasting the example Makefile to create a version for a new program, you can see the value in structuring it to be more general-purpose. After all, Makefiles are written for convenience! 

```
    NAME = blink
    CFLAGS  = -std=c99 -Og -g -Wall -ffreestanding
    LDFLAGS = -nostdlib

    all: $(NAME).bin

    $(NAME).bin: $(NAME).c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $(NAME).c -o $(NAME).o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(LDFLAGS) $(NAME).o -o $(NAME).elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy $(NAME).elf -O binary $(NAME).bin
    
    clean: 
        rm -f *.bin *.o
```
We've added three __macros__ up top. They're similar to variables
in that they replace instances of the macro throughout the file with their assigned text.
The `$(macro_name)` syntax is used to access the value of the macro.
This makes it easy to change the name for a new program.

### Pattern rules
We can further generalize our Makefile by using _pattern rules_ that can be used to operate on any source file, without hard-coding to a particular name.

```
    # This pattern rule compiles a C program into an object file.
    # filename.o is built from filename.c
    %.o: %.c
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

    # This pattern rule converts assembly instructions into an object file.
    # filename.o is built from filename.s
    %.o: %.s
        arm-none-eabi-as $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

    # This pattern rule links an object file into an executable ELF file.
    # filename.elf is built from filename.o
    %.elf: %.o
        arm-none-eabi-gcc $(LDFLAGS) $< -o $@

    # This pattern rule extract binary from an ELF executable
    # filename.bin is built from filename.elf
    %.bin: %.elf
        arm-none-eabi-objcopy $< -O binary $@
```

The symbols that begin with `$` and `%` in a pattern rule are handled by `make` using the following interpretations:

* `%` is a wildcard symbol when used in a rule; `%.o` for example matches any file that ends with `.o`
* `$@` refers to the left part of the rule, before the `:`
* `$<` refers to the first element in the right part of the rule, after the `:`

One more special variable `$^` refers to all elements in the right part of the rule, after the `:`, which is to say all of the dependencies.

For further convenience, we can add a rule for the `install` target. We use this target to invoke the command `rpi-install.py blink.bin` to load our newly-built program on the Pi.

    # The install target uploads a freshly made binary image to rpi bootloader
    install: $(NAME).bin
        rpi-install.py $<

With that finishing touch, you have a general Makefile that can be easily re-purposed for any Raspberry Pi project. Now that you know that a Makefile is just a cookbook that culminates in the tasty program you wish to create, you're ready to add your favorite recipes and bon appetit!

__Q. Make is failing with a cryptic error about `Makefile: *** missing separator`. What gives?__

A. In what is widely considered one of the dumber decisions in the history of computing, a Makefile distinguishes between tabs and spaces. The recipe lines for a target must begin with a tab and an equivalent number of spaces just won't do. Edit your makefile and replace those errant spaces with a tab to restore Makefile joy.
