CS107E has a small kit for its lab and projects. The comes in a LDPE (Tupperware-type
plastic) box, and contains the following parts. We have found that if you are buying in reasonable numbers (e.g., for 20-100 students), [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) has very good prices, although it will take a few weeks to arrive.

* [a Raspberry Pi A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-1-model-a-plus/)
* [a MicroSDHC card with SD adapter jacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card)![SD card image](sdcard.jpg)
* [a USB-to-serial breakout board](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/cp2102-serial-converter-usb-2-0-to-ttl-uart-ftdi.html): we have found CP2102 work well, but so do FTDI
* [a full-sized breadboard](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/48646-dup-830-point-solder-less-plug-in-breadboard-clear.html)
* [twenty 1K resistors (for leds, 4-digit display, transistors)](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-8w-metal-film-resistors/r-1k-ohm-1-8w-1-metal-film-resistor.html)
* [four 10K resistors (for push buttons)](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/resistors/1-8w-metal-film-resistors/r-10k-ohm-1-8w-1-metal-film-resistor.html)
* [eight LEDs](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/leds/round-leds/5mm-leds/red/led-5mm-red-water-clear-ultra-bright.html)
* [a 4-digit 7-segment display (common cathode)](http://www.lanpade.com/7-segment-led-dot-matrix/5461as.html)
* [four tactile pushbuttons with colored caps](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/tact-switch-12-12mm-7-5mm-through-hole-spst-no.html)
* [four 2N3904 bipolar-junction transistors (BJTs)](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/2n3904-npn-general-propose-transistor.html)
* [ten (short, 10cm) female-female jumpers]
* [ten (long, 20cm) female-female jumpers](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/premium-jumper-wires-awg24-female-female-200mm-pack-of-40.html)
* [twenty (long, 20cm) female-male jumpers](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/premium-jumper-wires-awg24-female-male-200mm-pack-of-40.html)

You also use male-male jumpers in various lengths. These jumpers aren't included in the kit; you can pick up some in lab whenever the need comes up.

Doing the labs also requires a few small tools and equipment. When we teach CS107E on
campus, these are available in the lab. When we teach it remotely, we sent a kit of
these tools:

* wire snip
* wire stripper
* needlenose pliers
* a small spool of 22AWG solid core wire
* an inexpensive (<$20), low-speed (e.g., 24MHz) USB logic analyzer that works with PulseView

We often purchase the boxes from [Daiso](https://www.daisojapan.com/) because their
physical stores have very good quality boxes for very cheap.
