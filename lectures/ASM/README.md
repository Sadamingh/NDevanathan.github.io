readings: |
    + Before lecture, read/skim sections A3.1-A3.4 and A3.11 from the [ARM Instruction Set Architecture](/readings/armisa.pdf) manual. 
    + An [interactive demo of ARM immediate value encoding](https://alisdair.mcdiarmid.org/arm-immediate-value-encoding/#play-with-it). A tribute to how much can be done with just an 8-bit value and barrel shifter!
    + Enjoy Danny Cohen's article
     [Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace](/readings/holywars.pdf) on the history of little-endian vs. big-endian.
