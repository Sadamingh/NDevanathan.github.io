## Goals
For this week's assignment, you are again acting in the role of
library implementer to add a debugging aid (`backtrace.c`)
and a heap allocator (`malloc.c`) to your growing
collection of foundational routines. 

Global and local variables have been sufficient for our needs thus far, but 
to support more complex applications we'll need support for dynamic allocation 
Dynamic allocation (a heap) offers the programmer explicit and 
direct control over sizing and lifetime of storage. With this
power comes with the responsibility to properly allocate and
deallocate that memory. Using dynamic memory correctly and safely is a
challenge for the client; implementing a heap allocator correctly
and efficiently is a challenge for the implementer.

After you finish this assignment, you will:

- be able to dissect the runtime stack in an executing program,

- further understand C data structures and memory layout,

- have more experience managing pointers in C, and

- appreciate some of the complexity and tradeoffs in implementing a heap allocator.

Each new assignment also provides many opportunities to appreciate and value your
hard work in previous weeks. You'll come to love how much easier _your_ `printf` makes
your testing and debugging.  By the end of the quarter, almost every single 
instruction in your fully functioning console will be from code you have written
and know well: you'll understand your whole system from the ground up.

## Get starter files

To ensure that your courseware files are up to date, do a pull in the `cs107e.github.io`
repo. 

```
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/cs107e.github.io
$ git pull
```

To ensure that you have the latest starter code, change to your local assignments
repo, checkout the master branch, and pull from the starter code remote.

```
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/assignments
$ git checkout master
$ git pull starter-code master
```

Now create your `assign4-basic` branch, merge in your work from `assign3-basic`,
and create the `Makefile` symlink.

```
$ git checkout -b assign4-basic
$ git merge assign3-basic
$ ls -l Makefile
$ ln -sf $(pwd)/makefiles/assign4.makefile $(pwd)/Makefile
$ ls -l Makefile
```

You have the option of building on your own code as you move forward or switching
out your modules for our library versions. Edit the setting `MY_MODULES` in the 
Makefile to control which modules of yours are used and which of ours. Verify that
the files `gpio.c`, `timer.c`, `strings.c`, and `printf.c` in your assign4-basic
branch are up-to-date versions of your modules if you would like to use your implementations 
from previous assignments. Using your own modules now will put you on track to receive 
the full system integration bonus after completing assignment 7.

Here are the files of interest for this week:
- `src/lib/backtrace.c`: you'll implement the required functions within this module.
- `src/lib/malloc.c`: you'll implement the required functions within this module.
- `src/tests/test_backtrace_malloc.c`: you'll add many tests to this file to
  verify that your implementations of `backtrace` and `malloc` work as expected.
- `src/apps/heapclient.c`: you'll leave this file unchanged but use it as a
  sample application.

The `make install` target of the Makefile builds the sample application
`src/apps/heapclient.c` into `build/bin/heapclient.bin` and runs it on the Pi. The
`make test` target builds `src/tests/test_backtrace_malloc.c` into `build/bin/test_backtrace_malloc.bin`
and runs it on the Pi. With no argument, `make` will build both, but run neither. You
can use the debugger in simulator mode on the corresponding ELF file, e.g. 
`arm-none-eabi-gdb build/elf/test_backtrace_malloc.elf`.

## Basic section

### Backtrace module
The `backtrace` module provides functionality to gather and print a stack backtrace.
A backtrace is a listing of the function call stack beginning at the currently executing 
function, showing the sequence of calls that led to this function, and ending at
`_cstart`.

Consider a program whose `main` function calls `tokenize`, which then calls `strndup`.
A backtrace initiated during `strndup` could look something like this: 

```
#0 0x8090 at strndup+40
#1 0x814c at tokenize+116
#3 0x8354 at main+24
#4 0x83c0 at _cstart+48
```

The functions in `src/lib/backtrace.c` are:

- `int backtrace(frame_t f[], int max_frames)`
- `void print_frames(frame_t f[], int n)`
- `void print_backtrace(void)`
- `const char *name_of(uintptr_t fn_start_addr)`


Review our [backtrace.h](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io/blob/master/cs107e/include/backtrace.h) 
for module documentation. The two `print_` functions are given to you pre-written. 
You are to implement the `name_of` and `backtrace` functions. `name_of` finds the
name for a given function and  `backtrace` fills an array of stack frame information.
These two functions are small but mighty. Completing them will demonstrate your 
understanding of the stack layout and show off your finest pointer skills. Before
writing any code for the backtrace module, we recommend that you first spend time
poking around in `gdb` and exploring the runtime state of the program, examining stack 
memory, stepping through function calls, and manually accessing the stack frame 
data, and so on. Exercise 4 of [Lab 4](/labs/lab4/#4-stack) may be worth a second
look.

#### An example backtrace

The `backtrace` function fills an array of structs, one `frame_t` for each function 
on the stack. Read [backtrace.h](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io/blob/master/cs107e/include/backtrace.h) 
to see the type definition of the struct `frame_t`, including the comments which
explain the intent of the fields `resume_addr` and `resume_offset`.

The `backtrace` function starts at the innermost stack frame and traces to the outermost,
harvesting the information for each stack frame and storing into a `frame_t`.

The current value of the `fp` register is the "anchor" you need to start examining
the stack. You must drop down to assembly to access a register. The GCC `__asm__`
keyword allows you to mix assembly in with your C code. The code sample below demonstrates
using embedded assembly to store the value of the `fp` register into a variable 
named `cur_fp`:

```
void *cur_fp;
__asm__("mov %0, fp" : "=r" (cur_fp));
```

{% include callout.html type="info" %}
Don't worry much about the quirky syntax of GCC's inline assembly. Unless you
use it a lot, it's unlikely that you'll remember the exact details. It's
sufficient to know that you can combine C and assembly in this way. If you're
interested in learning more, you can check out the manual:
[gcc support for inline assembly](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Using-Assembly-Language-with-C.html).
</div>

We are using the `code/simple` program from lab3/lab4 as our example below. Have
the Lab 4 [memory diagram for simple](/labs/lab4/images/stack_abs.html) handy when 
working through the following thought questions.

- The executing function is `abs()`. What is the value of the `fp` register? Relative
  to the `fp`, where in the stack can you read the `resume_addr` for the caller of `abs()`?
- How can you work from the `fp` for `abs()` to access the saved `fp` of its caller,
  the `diff` function?  How does the saved `fp` grant you access to the stack frame
  for `diff`? How do you then go from `diff`'s frame to the frame of its caller,
  the `main` function? What is the indication that you have hit the outermost stack
  frame? This is where backtrace stops.
- The `resume_offset` is calculated by subtracting the address of the first instruction 
  of the caller from the resume address in the caller. What information in the stack
  frame for `diff` helps you locate its first instruction? (Hint: may help to re-visit
  question 4 on the [lab4 check-in](/labs/lab4/checkin/) for some foreshadowing 
  about this calculation.)

The final task in harvesting the backtrace is to associate the name of the function
with each stack frame. Symbol names are usually not present in a binary file as 
functions are referred to by address, not name. However, there is a compiler option
to retain function names in the binary to support developers (such as yourself)
writing debugging tools. The assignment makefile has the flag `-mpoke-function-name`
enabled in `CFLAGS`. This option tells gcc to store a function's name with the compiled
instructions, embedded in the memory preceding the function's first instruction. 

{% include callout.html type="danger" %}
The documentation below is taken from the gcc manual, but we have corrected a few
mis-identified details. Please use this version rather than refer back to the original.

   > length `(value & ~0xff000000)`.

The `name_of` function is given the address of a function's first instruction and
finds the embedded function name, if available. If the word preceding a function's
first instruction in memory has `0xff` in its most significant byte, this indicates
that the function has its name embedded. The name's length is stored in the lower
three bytes of the word. Use that length to back up in memory to the start of the
string. Neat! If you don't find the magic `0xff` in the right place, this indicates
the function name is not available, in which case, `name_of` should return `"???"`.

The embedded function name is null-terminated and the terminator is counted in the
length. The `.align` directive rounds up the length to a multiple of 4; additional
null characters are used as padding.  A function named `binky` will have its name
embedded as `binky\0\0\0` and length of 8. Given that the name is stored with its
null terminator, `name_of` can access the string in-place and simply refer to it
by address without making a copy of of the string.

If our previous example program is re-compiled with the `-mpoke-function-name` flag,
the text section will contain the function names embedded alongside the instructions,
(see [memory diagram with embedded function names](images/diagram_with_poke.html)).
Using this diagram as a guide, work out by what steps you could access a function's
name if starting from the address for the function's first instruction. This is 
what needs to happen in `name_of`.

Put this all together and you have a module capable of harvesting a backtrace for
the current stack, including function names. It requires surprisingly little code,
but it's dense and heavy on the pointer arithmetic and typecasts. Carefully map 
out your approach, take it slow, and use `gdb` as you go to examine memory and print
expressions to confirm your steps. Validating your backtrace against `gdb`'s `backtrace`
command can also be a useful debugging technique.

The stack layout follows a rigid convention, so once you have code to correctly 
backtrace a stack, it is likely to work equally well for all other stacks without
special cases. Confirm with some well-thought-out tests and you're ready to move on.

### Malloc module

The job of the heap allocator is to service allocation requests and manage the pool
of available space.

The functions you are to implement in `malloc.c` are:

- `void \*malloc(size_t nbytes)`
- `void free(void \*ptr)`
- `void \*realloc(void \*ptr, size_t new_size)`
 
The module documentation in [malloc.h](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io/blob/master/cs107e/include/malloc.h)
describes the functions. They operate in the same spirit as the same-named allocation 
functions of the standard C library. 

The essential requirement for any heap allocator is that it correctly service any
combination of well-formed requests.  It is also desirable that it be space-efficient
(recycling freed memory, compactly storing blocks) and fast (quickly servicing 
requests). For the assignment, your primary goal will be to achieve correctness,
with a lesser priority on efficiency.

#### Malloc specification

Refer to the module documentation in [malloc.h](https://github.com/cs107e/cs107e.github.io/blob/master/cs107e/include/malloc.h)
for the operational behavior of each function. Other than the non-negotiable stipulation 
to correctly service all valid requests, there are very few requirements to the 
specification itself. 

All pointers returned by `malloc` are required be aligned to 8 bytes, the size of
the largest primitive type on our system. 

If `malloc` cannot fulfill an allocation request, it returns `NULL`.  Four valid,
but oddball cases to consider are `malloc(0)`, `realloc(NULL, size)`,  `realloc(ptr, 0)`
and `free(NULL)`.  The expectation for these edge cases is given in the `malloc.h`
documentation.

If a client request is invalid, such as an attempt to `realloc` a random pointer
that was not obtained from `malloc` or `free`ing an already freed pointer, the behavior 
of the allocator is undefined. We will not test such invalid calls.

#### Order of attack
Below we offer our suggestions for a step-by-step plan  of the tasks before you. 


1. **Study starter code.**

   Start by reviewing the given code for the "bump allocator" in the file `malloc.c`.
   This bump allocator is simple and correct, but fairly naive. It serves as a reference
   point from which your own heap allocator will be able to show substantial improvements.
   
   Make sure you understand what each line in the bump allocator is doing. Your allocator
   will be significantly more complicated, so it is best to start from a solid foundation.
   Here are some self-test questions to work through to verify your understanding:
   
   - Trace the given code for `sbrk`. You will use this code as-is and it is important
     that you understand exactly what this function does for you and how to use it.
     Where does the heap segment start in memory? Where does it end? How does it enlarge?
     How big can it grow? What is the result of attempting to grow beyond the available
     limit?
   - Why does the code cast pointers to `char \*` before doing pointer arithmetic?
   - If you request a 5-byte allocation, how much space is actually reserved?
   - Every allocation is required to be 8-byte aligned (i.e. payload must start on an
     address which is a multiple of 8). How does the bump allocator achieve this requirement?
   - Why is the bump allocator unable to recycle a previous allocation that has been
     freed?
   - Review the documentation for the `realloc` operation. Review the realloc code in
     the bump allocator and confirm your understanding of how the code accomplishes
     resizing the block. The bump allocator never performs an in-place realloc. What
     is meant by an "in-place realloc" and how does that compare to what the bump allocator
     does instead?

2. **Re-work `malloc()` to add a block header to each block.**
    
   Your heap allocator will place a header on each block that tracks the block size
   and status (in-use or free).  Review these [block header diagrams](block_headers/)
   to understand the basic layout of a heap using block headers.
   
   The bump allocator services a `malloc` request by extending from the break to place
   the new block at the previous heap end. Continue with the same strategy for now,
   but augment the operation to add a block header on the block.
   
   When adding the header, be sure to consider how it will affect payload alignment.
   Each payload must start on an address that is a multiple of 8. One convenient way
   to adhere to the alignment rule is to round up each payload to a size that is a multiple
   of 8, add an 8-byte header, and lay out blocks end to end starting from an address
   that is a multiple of 8. Our standard `memmap` aligns the `__bss_end__` symbol to
   an 8-byte boundary.

3. **Implement `free()` to update status in block header.**
   
   `free()` should access the block's header and mark it as free. Accessing the neighboring
   memory at a negative offset via pointer subtraction works just like pointer addition
   -- handy!
   
   This doesn't yet recycle a free block, but marking it as free is the first step toward
   that.

4. **Implement `heap_dump()` to output debugging information.**
   
   Before things get any more complex, implement a routine to give you insight into
   what's going on inside your heap.  The intention of `heap_dump()` is to print a visual
   dump of your heap contents that will help you when debugging your allocator.  Yay
   `printf`, where have you been all my life?!  
   
   As a starting point, we suggest that `heap_dump` walk the heap and print each block.
   Starting from the first block, traverse from block to block until you reach the heap
   end. You can move from a block header to its forward neighbor by using pointer arithmetic
   to advance by the block size. The block headers are said to form an _implicit list_.
   
   For each block, print the payload address and size and status. You might also elect
   to print the payload data. If so, we recommend abbreviating by perhaps displaying
   only the first 16 bytes. If you instead print out every single byte, the output can
   become overwhelming for larger heaps. 
   
   Use the `trace_heap()` test in `tests/test_backtrace_malloc.c` to try out `heap_dump`.
   You can add calls to `heap_dump()` wherever desired to get a visual dump of your
   heap contents for debugging. If you inspect the dump and see that your heap is in
   a corrupted state, add calls to dump earlier in the sequence and try to pinpoint
   the exact operation where your heap went from good to bad. Having an inside view
   of what's going on inside your heap is an invaluable aid for debugging.

   What you print in `heap_dump` will not be graded. This debugging function is yours
   to use as you see fit, but the more help it provides to you, the better off you
   will be.

5. **Upgrade `malloc()` to search freed blocks and reuse/split.**
      
   Now change `malloc` to recycle a free block if possible. Walk the heap by traversing
   the implicit list of headers, and look for a free block of an appropriate size. A
   block that exactly matched the requested size would be ideal, but searching the entire
   heap to find that best fit block can be time-consuming. A quicker fix is to go with
   _first fit_, i.e. grab the first block found that is large enough. If this block
   satisfies the request with enough excess leftover to form a second block, split off
   that remainder into its own free block.
   
   If no recyclable block is found, then just extend the heap and place the new block
   at the end as before.
   
   Concoct a sequence of malloc/free calls that should permit reuse and confirm with
   `heap_dump` that your allocator is recycling freed memory appropriately.

6. **Upgrade `free()` to coalesce adjacent free blocks.**
   
   Reusing single freed blocks is a good improvement, but there is further opportunity
   for recycling. What happens if the client repeatedly allocates 8-byte blocks until
   the heap is full, frees all of them, then tries to allocate a 32-byte block? The
   heap contains way more than 32 bytes of free space, but it has been fragmented 
   into individual 8-byte blocks.  To service a larger request, we'll need to join those
   smaller blocks.
   
   Modify `free()` so that when freeing a block, it checks if the block's forward neighbor
   is also free, and if so, it will _coalesce_ the two blocks into one combined free
   block. It then considers the forward neighbor of that bigger block to see if it's
   free and can also be coalesced. Continue forward-coalescing until no further coalescing
   is possible.
   
   Confirm forward-coalesce with test sequences and use of `heap_dump`.

7. **Upgrade `realloc()` to operate in-place when possible.**

   The final feature is to make a smarter `realloc`. The version of `realloc` given
   in the starter code always moves the payload data from the original block to a new
   block. If possible, we'd like to avoid that (expensive) copying and leave the payload
   data where it is. If the neighboring space is free, `realloc` could instead subsume
   the forward neighbor(s) into the original block, thereby resizing "in-place". Modify
   `realloc()` to seize this opportunity to resize the block in-place and only move
   the payload data when it must.

   Another round of tests and checking your heap contents with `heap_dump` and you've
   good to go!


__Congratulations!__ You have summited Heap Allocator Mountain ⛰ and earned your
Pointer Wrangling Merit Badge 🏆 Time to celebrate with a nice cup of tea ☕️, a moment
of mediation 🧘‍♀️, or a decadent nap in the sun ☀️.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

The `src/apps/heapclient.c` program contains sample client code adapted from lab4
that uses `backtrace` and `malloc`. Use this program unchanged as a basic sanity
test of your modules.

The `src/tests/test_backtrace_malloc.c` program is yours to fill with your comprehensive
suite of test cases. The starter code provides some example tests to get you started.
You will need to add many more tests to throughly exercise your heap allocator in
a wide variety of situations. A portion of your assignment grade is awarded based
on the quality and breadth of the test cases you submit.

In CS106B, you learned about a variety of dynamic data structures (linked lists,
trees, hash tables) and used them in the implementation of classic abstract data
types (vector, stack, queue, dictionary, set). Given your shiny new heap allocator,
you can now bring all that wonderful data structure goodness to your Pi. Porting
some of that code would make excellent and rigorous test cases for your allocator
and in the process, you would gain a library of useful ADTs -- win-win!

## Extension: Mini-Valgrind
The extension for this assignment is to combine your backtrace and malloc modules
to add a "Mini-Valgrind" set of memory debugging features to your heap allocator
to report on memory errors and memory leaks.

What happens if a client allocates a block of memory and then mistakenly writes
outside of the bounds?  The erroneous write not only stomps on the neighboring payload
data, it is almost certain to destroy the neighboring block header. A memory error
that corrupts this critical heap housekeeping will lead to many sad consequences. 

What happens if a client allocates a block, but forgets to free it when done? This
creates a _memory leak_, where the block is parked there forever, unable to be recycled.
A memory leak is much less devastating than a memory error, but can degrade performance
over time and eventually cause issues.

Memory debugging tools such as [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org) are invaluable weapons
in the battle against difficult-to-find memory errors and leaks. For the extension,
you are to implement a "Mini-Valgrind" that adds memory error and leak detection
to your heap allocator.

#### Red zones and leak detection

One technique for detecting memory over/underruns is to surround each payload with
a pair of _red zones_. When servicing a malloc request, oversize the space by an
extra 8 bytes. Place the actual payload in the middle with one 4-byte red zone before
it and another 4-byte red zone after it. (Take care to keep the payload aligned on
the 8-byte boundary). Fill the red zone with a distinctive value. Our implementation
uses a repeated `0x7e`, though you are free to use [any distinctive non-offensive
value you like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak). When the client later frees
that block, check the red zones and squawk loudly if the value has been perturbed.

In addition, you should tag each allocated block with the context it was allocated
from by recording a "mini-backtrace". Modify your block header structure to add an
array of three `frame_t` and fill with a snapshot of the innermost three frames at
the point this block was allocated. 

Modify `free` to verify that the red zones are intact for the block currently being
freed. If not, print an error message about the block in error along with its mini-backtrace
that identifies where the block was allocated from.

```
=============================================
 **********  Mini-Valgrind Alert  ********** 
=============================================
Attempt to free address 0x0000a978 that has damaged red zone(s): [457e7e7e] [7e7e7e7e]
Block of size 5 bytes, allocated by
#0 0x8d4c at malloc+192
#1 0x8650 at test_heap_redzones+52
#2 0x86bc at main+56
```

Format your error message as shown in the sample above. The values for the address,
damaged red zone, block size, etc. will differ based on the test case, but you should
otherwise exactly match the wording and format so as to be compatible with our automated
checker. 

Mini-Valgrind also tracks heap statistics, such as the count of calls to `malloc`
and `free` and the aggregate total number of bytes requested. Implement the function
`memory_report` that is intended to be used at program completion to print a summary
of the total heap usage and list all remaining memory leaks. The mini-backtrace stored
in the block header is used to identify the context for each leaked block.

```
=============================================
 **********  Mini-Valgrind Alert  ********** 
=============================================
malloc/free: 42 allocs, 40 frees, 5752 bytes allocated

8 bytes are lost, allocated by
#0 0x8d0c at malloc+196
#1 0x8674 at main+28
#2 0x86ec at _cstart+48

100 bytes are lost, allocated by
#0 0x8d0c at malloc+196
#1 0x868c at main+52
#2 0x86ec at _cstart+48

Lost 108 total bytes in 2 blocks. 
```

The format of your memory report should exactly match the wording and format of the
sample report shown above.

As a final detail, work out where you can call `memory_report()` so that Mini-Valgrind
can provide leak detection to any program, without modifying the application's
`main` or other application files? Hint: think about how the green LED turns on when
your test program runs to successful completion.

## Heap alligators
A note from Julie Zelenski, CS Lecturer:

At home, my chatter about "heap allocators" was mistaken for "heap alligators" by
my kids, who were alarmed that I would ask my students to wrestle with such fearsome
beasts. 

A family trip to Gatorland taught us that a heap __of__ alligators can actually
be quite cute (see photo) and the adorable drawing from Jane Lange (talented CS107e
alum, former CS107e TA, and current MIT PhD student) demonstrates that a tamed heap
alligator makes a lovely pet. May you, too, tame your heap alligator and triumph
over the perils of dynamic allocation.
