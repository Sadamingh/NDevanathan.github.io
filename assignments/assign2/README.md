### Goals
Your next assignment is to build a clock using a 4-digit 7-segment
display.

The goals of this assignment are for you to:

- Get started with bare metal programming in C on the Raspberry Pi.
- Begin building a simple, modular library of useful functions.
- Learn how to write and use automated test cases to validate your code's behavior.
- Learn how to use the Raspberry Pi's system timer peripheral.
- Use your gpio and timer modules in the clock application.

### Get starter files

To ensure that your courseware files are up to date, do a pull in the `cs107e.github.io`
repo. 

```
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/cs107e.github.io
$ git pull
```

To ensure that you have the latest starter code, change to your local assignments
repo, checkout the master branch, and pull from the starter code remote.

```
$ cd ~/cs107e_home/assignments
$ git checkout master
$ git pull starter-code master
```

Now create your `assign2-basic` branch and create the `Makefile` symlink.

```
$ git checkout -b assign2-basic
$ ls -l Makefile
$ ln -sf $(pwd)/makefiles/assign2.makefile $(pwd)/Makefile
$ ls -l Makefile
```

Skim through `src/lib/gpio.c`, `src/lib/timer.c`, and `src/apps/clock.c` to get
a sense of what you'll be implementing this week. Also take a look at the [magic files](#magic)
in `src/boot` if you'd like: `memmap`, `start.s`, `cstart.c`. These three files are
necessary for bare metal C programs, and we'll take a look at them in an upcoming
lecture.

### Modular design

For this assignment, you will implement functions across three different C files:
`src/lib/gpio.c`, `src/lib/timer.c`, and `src/apps/clock.c`. The first two files
implement reusable modules, the latter is the application program file. 
**Do not create any new source files or directories; add your code by editing the given files.**

The `gpio` and `timer` modules provide access to two of the Raspberry Pi peripherals.
The `gpio` module has routines that control the GPIO pins and the `timer` module
retrieves the system tick count. The two modules are used by `src/apps/clock.c`,
but, more broadly, these modules are designed to be reusable in any future application
that requires similar functionality. These two modules are the first of many more
to come. By the end of the quarter, you will have implemented a complete set of modules
that will give you a library of core functions for your Raspberry Pi.

Each module is divided into an _interface_ and its _implementation_. The module 
interface is described in its header file, e.g. `gpio.h` or `timer.h`. Each public
function is listed with its name, prototype, and documentation about what the function
does. The module implementation is in the corresponding `.c` file where those functions
are defined. 

This idea of separating interface and implementation is fundamental to all software
engineering: projects might choose different file naming conventions, but they always
separate interface from implementation. Doing so abstracts away the implementation
from a user, meaning that they can use the module without thinking about the underlying
code that implements it. It also allows you to change the implementation without
causing any problems -- this may become very valuable towards the end of the course
if you want to swap out your implementation for a reference one written by the staff.

For the `gpio` and `timer` modules, we specify the module interface; it is your 
job to write the module implementation to match it. You are not to change anything
in the `gpio.h` and `timer.h` header files. All your edits will be in the `gpio.c`
and `timer.c` source files. You should not export additional public `gpio_` or `timer_`
functions. However, you can add your own private helper functions by declaring those
functions at the top of the C file with the `static` keyword to make them only accessible
to the implementation. 

{% include callout.html type="info" %}
The module header files don't live in your assignments repo, and so you might be
wondering where they all are. If you examine the `$CS107E/include` directory,
you'll see all of the module header files for all of the assignments, plus a few
more that correspond to modules that you don't need to implement. 
```
$ ls $CS107E/include
```
</div>

The file `src/apps/clock.c` will contain code that you write to configure and operate
your clock. The clock application does not directly access the peripherals, but instead
calls on the public functions of the `gpio` and `timer` modules. There is no required
interface for the clock application, but you should strive for a clean and well-decomposed
program that would make your CS106 section leader proud.

From here on out, each assignment will be structured in the same way: you'll
implement a few library modules that a runnable app will then leverage to do
some interesting thing.

### Testing

Now that you're writing larger programs, it's time to learn how to test your program.
We hope that the testing strategies will erve you well throughout your life as a
programmer.

The starter project includes an additional program file `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c`
that defines an alternate `main()` function. Instead of running the clock, this `main()`
function makes a series of calls to `gpio` and `timer` functions and uses `assert()`
in order to validate the operations work correctly. Use `make test` to build and
run this test program.

Recall from Lab 2 how `assert()` drives the red and green LEDs on the Pi as a simple
status indicator. If an assert fails, the program halts and blinks the red LED of
doom. If all asserts pass and the program finishes normally and the green LED of
happiness will turn on. Your goal is to make that little green light shine!

The given `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c` only has a few very simple tests. You should
extend the test program with many additional tests of your own so that you thoroughly
exercise the functionality of your modules. _Unit-testing_ each module in isolation
before going on to integrate its use into an application is an important strategy
for managing the development process as your programs become larger and more complex.  

Learning how to effectively test your code is an important component of growing your
programming skills, and we want to be sure to reward you for your testing efforts.
The breadth and depth of the tests you add to `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c` will
be used to determine a portion of your grade for this assignment (that is, to get
full credit on this assignment, you will need to include a thorough suite of tests
as part of your submission).

### Basic part: a simple clock
<A name="clock_spec"></a>
#### 1. Wire up clock hardware 

The first step is to build the hardware for your display.

- Complete the breadboard circuit for the 4-digit 7-segment display you started in
  [Lab 2](/labs/lab2). Test your breadboard with jumper cables so that you know the
  wiring is correct before you connect it to the Raspberry Pi. 
- In total, you will use 13 GPIOs on the Pi: eight pins to control which segments
  are on, four to control which digits are on, and one to read the state of the 
  start button.
- Connect GPIO pins 20-26 to the 1K current-limiting resistors on your breadboard
  that drive segments A through G. GPIO 20 controls segment A, GPIO 21 controls segment
  B, and so on. An 8th pin, GPIO 27, can be used to control the decimal point, which
  is optional. 
- Connect GPIO pins 10-13 to the base of the transistors controlling digits 1 through 4.
  GPIO 10 controls the first digit, GPIO 11 the second digit, and so on.
- Connect GPIO 2 to the red start button. The start button should be connected to
  the power rail through a 10K pull-up resistor; making the default state high. Pressing
  the button grounds the circuit, pulling the reading low.
- At this point if you output 3.3V on GPIO 20 and 3.3V on GPIO 10, you should turn
  on segment A of digit 1. Hooray!
- Snap a photo of your finished hardware setup, add the photo to your repo with the
  name `board`, and commit the image file to your repo. We want to see your beautiful
  handiwork!

Here's a photo of our clock breadboard connected to the Raspberry Pi. We selected
jumper colors in a repeating pattern (yellow-green-blue-violet) to help identify
which connection is which.

#### 2. Implement and test gpio module

Review Chapter 6 of the [Broadcom BCM2835 peripheral manual](/readings/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf#page=89)
which documents the GPIO peripheral. The device registers `FSEL`, `SET`, `CLR` and
`LEV` will be used in your `gpio` module implementation.

Open the file `$CS107E/include/gpio.h` and read the module documentation to learn
about the module as a whole and the expected behavior of each function. Your functions
must correctly implement each of the public functions. In addition, your functions
should also be robust against client error. If asked to set an invalid pin or function,
your function should not blunder on to wrong or broken behavior. The function documentation
in the module interface gives specific guidance on the expected handling for improper
calls.

We recommend that the first functions you implement are `gpio_set_function` and
`gpio_get_function`. These operations use the `FSEL` device registers to configure
the mode of a GPIO pin. Thus far we have only seen the input and output modes, but
there are additional modes. See the module interface (`$CS107E/include/gpio.h`)
for the additional alternate modes that you must support. Implement `gpio_set_input`
and `gpio_set_output` as simple wrapper functions that call `gpio_set_function` to
set the given pin to input or output, respectively.

Before moving on, test what you've implemented. Edit the `main()` function of `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c`
to uncomment the call to `test_gpio_set_get_function()`.  Run `make test` to build
and execute the test program on the Pi. If the green LED on the Pi turns on, all
tests ran successfully -- bravo! If instead the Pi's red LED is flashing, this means
you are failing a test.  If neither LED lights up, your program may be freezing or
crashing somewhere during the tests.

If you don't get the green light, comment out all of the asserts within `test_gpio_set_get_function()`.
Uncomment the asserts one-by-one and re-run after each addition to determine which
specific test is failing. Use that information to narrow in on your bug, fix it,
and re-test until you achieve the green light of nirvana.

Passing these tests shows you're off to a great start, but the provided test coverage
is not comprehensive. You will need to add test cases of your own to definitively
confirm the full correctness of your module. To jumpstart your brainstorming, consider
what additional tests could be used to:

- confirm setting a GPIO pin to alternate function modes, not just input or output
- confirm can configure a GPIO pin in each of the different FSEL registers
- confirm no interference when configuring multiple GPIO pins within the same FSEL register
- confirm that improper requests are gracefully handled

What other cases can you think of to add to the above? As you add each new test case,
build and re-run your test program to verify success. Don't move on until you are
bathed in green light on your now-comprehensive test suite.

{% include callout.html type="danger" %}
When writing test cases, take note that certain GPIO pins exhibit specialized behavior.
GPIO pins 14 and 15 are used for serial transmission and by default have the function
`GPIO_FUNC_ALT5`.  Manipulating these pins will disrupt the communication between
your computer and the Pi. __You do not need to include pins 14 and 15 in your tests.__
GPIO 35 controls the red power LED on the Pi and GPIO 47 the green ACT LED. If you
manipulate these pins, the corresponding LED will be affected. This is to be expected.
</div>

The remaining gpio functions to implement are `gpio_write` and `gpio_read`. These
functions read and write the current pin state by accessing the `SET`, `CLR`, and
`LEV` device registers.

After you've implemented these functions, test them by uncommenting the call to
`test_gpio_read_write()` in the `main()` function of `tests/test_gpio_timer.c`. Re-run
the test program, look for the green light, and make necessary fixes until you achieve
success.

Remember that the test coverage provided in the starter code is a good start, but
you will need to supplement with additional test cases to achieve thorough coverage.
The test cases used by the automated tester in grading are quite rigorous. Rather
than wait for our grading tests to ferret out issues for you to fix, the challenge
goal for you is to find and fix any problems before you submit. We want your code
to sail through grading with flying colors.

Keep up the habit of __frequent git commits__ and push to sync history with your
GitHub remote repository. This gives you an audit trail of your progress and an "off-site"
backup to ensure that all of your great work is safely recorded.


__A note on volatile__

Writing code that correctly interacts with a peripheral will require understanding
of the `volatile` keyword.  Remember from lecture that qualifying a variable as `volatile`
indicates that its value could change unexpectedly. Consider this pointer to the
memory-mapped GPIO device register `LEV0`:

```
unsigned int *lev = (unsigned int *)0x20200034;
```

The data at that address can, and should, be qualified as `volatile`:

```
volatile unsigned int *lev = (unsigned int *)0x20200034;
```

Adding the `volatile` qualifier informs the compiler that the `unsigned int` value
can change due to events not apparent in the code. You read the LEV0 register to
get the current value of an input pin. Whether that value read is 0 or 1 depends
on what is physically connected to the pin, which can change externally. If every
iteration of a loop in C reads from `*lev` and there is no intervening write to that
location inside the loop, the optimizer could move the read operation outside the
loop and only execute it once on the assumption that the value will not change.
If `lev` is qualified as pointing to a `volatile` int, the compiler cannot make that
assumption and must re-read the value for each and every access.  

Note that `volatile` is not something to throw about willy-nilly. Apply it thoughtfully
and intentionally to those specific data values that need to be treated in this special
manner. Extraneous use of `volatile` can be misleading and will reduce performance
as it disallows the compiler from making optimizations.


Congratulations on completing your first Raspberry Pi module!


#### 3. Display a digit

For your next task, turn your attention to the clock application and put your shiny
new gpio module to work to drive the 7-segment display.

In `apps/clock.c`, create an array of 16 elements, one for each hexadecimal value between 0 and 15. Each array element should
be a byte (8-bits). Bit 0 (the least significant) will represent segment A, bit 1
segment B, and so on. If a bit is set, then that segment should be lit. For example,
digit `0` consists of segments A-F, so its bit pattern is `0b00111111`. Digit `1`
consists of just segments B and C, so its bit pattern is `0b00000110`.  (`0b` is
the prefix that introduces a binary number literal, just as `0x` prefixes a hexadecimal
literal.)

Bit 7 (the most significant) will be used to represent `DP`, the dot. Since we won't
be using the dot in this assignment, bit 7 should always be 0.

Create bit patterns for all the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D,
E, F. You won't be displaying A-F for this assignment, but they may be useful in
the future.  This [interactive demo of a 7-segment display ](http://www.uize.com/examples/seven-segment-display.html)
is handy for seeing how the bit pattern relates to the character segments.

Add code to the `main()` function of `apps/clock.c` to display a single digit. Verify
that your bit patterns are correct by displaying each digit value from `0` to `F`.
Use `make install` to build and run your clock application.

#### 4. Implement and test timer module

In order to implement a clock, we'll need some way to determine the passage of time.
Thankfully, the Raspberry Pi includes a "system timer". The system timer is an on-board
peripheral that is initialized to zero when the Pi powers up and is continuously
incremented once every microsecond behind the scenes. 

Chapter 12 of the [Broadcom BCM2835 Peripherals Manual](/readings/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf#page=172)
contains the documentation for the system timer peripheral. For this module, note
that we only care about the lower 32-bits of the system timer. Don't forget that
we use [ARM physical addresses](/readings/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf#page=6), not
bus addresses (0x7E... for peripherals), so you'll need to change the 0x7E... prefix
in any peripheral address to 0x20.

The `timer` module defines functions that access the system timer. Read the interface
to the module in the `$CS107E/include/timer.h` header. Review the given code for
the module implementation in `src/lib/timer.c`. 

Your one task for the `timer` module is to implement the function `timer_get_ticks` to read
the current system tick count from the system timer. 

Uncomment the call `test_timer()` in `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c`. Use `make test`
to build and re-run the test program. Verify the given tests succeed and then consider
what additional tests are needed for the timer module (there may not be much; it
is a pretty simple module). Once both the gpio and timer modules are passing all
of your tests, you're ready to tackle the rest of the clock application.

#### 5. Write display refresh loop

GPIO pins 20 to 26 drive the seven segments A to G. Segments A to G are shared by
all four digits on the display. There is no way to turn on the display segments to
show a `5` on the leftmost digit while simultaneously showing a `3` on the rightmost
digit.

Instead, you will write a display refresh loop that drives the four digits by iterating
over the digits one-by-one in quick succession. It turns on the segments for the
leftmost digit, waits a short length of time, and turns off that digit, then repeats
the process for each of the other three digits. You might think that turning a digit
on and off would cause it to flicker. The key is to sequence through the digits so
fast that our eyes cannot see them changing. Good thing computers are fast!

Implement the display refresh loop in `src/apps/clock.c`. Use the functions from
the `timer` module to control the wait time. Loop though all four digits, turning
each on for 2500 microseconds. Do you see any flicker? How long does the delay have
to for you to start to see it?

#### 6. Implement clock

The program for the basic assignment starts by showing `----` on the display and
waits for the user to click the start button. The clock then displays the elapsed
minutes and seconds since start. A loop continually refreshes the display, updating
the value displayed to match the elapsed time. Make sure to test that the timer is
calibrated correctly so the clock is counting at the right rate.

The clock time is counting elapsed time since the clock was started, which is not
quite the value as the system tick count. Clock time and the system tick count change
at the same rate, but start at different values. Your program will need to implement
this logic.

This video shows starting our Raspberry Pi clock and counting to 12 seconds:

__Mission accomplished!__ Follow our [submit instructions](#submit) and it's time
to celebrate. You have wired up a complex breadboard circuit, written two reusable
library modules and a clock application, as well as working up a methodology for
testing your code. Be sure to show off your spiffy new clock to your followers (but
not to the TSA next time you pass through airport security...).

### Extension: Set time
If you're looking for an extra challenge, consider doing the optional extension to
create an interface to set the clock time.

After you have submitted your basic version, create an extension branch with

```
$ git checkout -b assign2-extension
```

Add a second blue button to your clock breadboard next to the red button. Connect
the blue button to GPIO pin 3. Design a user interface that allows you to set the
time using these buttons. You should be able to set the minutes and seconds separately.
Strive for an interface design that is easy to use and that works even after the
clock starts running. It can be challenging to build an [interface with just a few buttons](https://dilbert.com/strip/2016-06-12)! 

Commit a `clock-extension.md` file on your `assign2-extension` branch that describes
your extension. Your documentation should explain to the user how to set the time
via the red and blue buttons.

When reading button presses on the Pi, you will quickly realize that pressing the
button once may cause the value on the GPIO pin to change multiple times.  This is
due to physical characteristics of the button mechanism which cause the button circuit
to open and close multiple times during a press. To address this issue, implement
**debouncing** by checking whether the value change on the GPIO pin corresponds to
an actual button press or one of these spurious events. This can be done by checking
that the GPIO pin reads the button press value for a long enough time (that is, these
spurious events will change the GPIO value quickly, meaning if you check the value
of the pin as pressed, then wait a bit longer and see it as unpressed, that means
it was a spurious event). Experiment with the amount of time required to register
a valid press so that your buttons click easily without having to hold them down
too long, but do not generate extra button press events for a single physical button
press.


### Magic files <a name="magic"></a>

The starter project contains additional code files `src/boot/start.s` and `src/boot/cstart.c` and the
file `src/boot/memmap`. The `memmap` file is used by the linker when building the program
and `start.s` and `cstart.c` provide the minimum startup to set up a C program to
run in the bare metal environment. A bit later in the course, we will study these
files to understand how they work and why they are necessary. Feel free to look into
the files now to get a sneak preview, but don't worry if you don't fully understand
them yet. We will discuss them in more detail soon!

### Submit

The deliverables for `assign2-basic` are:

+ a photo of your completed breadboard
+ implementations of the `src/lib/gpio.c` and `src/lib/timer.c` modules
+ comprehensive tests for both modules in `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c`
+ application program `apps/clock.c`

Submit the finished version of your assignment by making a git "pull request",
following the steps given in the [Assignment 0 writeup](/assignments/assign0/).
Remember to make separate pull requests for your basic and extension
submissions.

### Grading

To grade this assignment, we will:

+ Verify that your project builds correctly, with no warnings (see Note 1 below)
+ Run automated tests that exercise the functionality of your `gpio` and `timer`
  modules. These tests will touch on all required features of the module. (see Note 2 below)
+ Observe your clock application running on a Raspberry Pi wired to a clock breadboard
  and confirm it operates correctly. Our hardware setup will be configured exactly
  as specified in [Step 1 above](#clock_spec).
+ Admire the photo you submit of your completed breadboard.
+ Go over the tests you added to `src/tests/test_gpio_timer.c` and evaluate them for
  thoughtfulness and completeness in coverage.
+ Review your code and provide feedback on your design and style choices.

Note 1: The automated tester will __deduct one point for any warnings generated when
compiling your code__. Warnings are the way the compiler draws attention to a code
passage that isn't an outright error but appears suspect. Some warnings are mild/harmless,
but others are critically important. If you get in the habit of keeping your code
compiling cleanly, you'll never miss a crucial message in a sea of warnings you are
casually ignoring. By default, all warnings will be treated as errors in your makefile,
and your code will be graded in the same way

Note 2: If your modules fail some of the automated tests, we will report those to
you by filing issues against your repo on GitHub. To promote the practice of fixing
your bugs, you will have the opportunity to re-submit with corrections for these
issues for a partial refund of the points originally deducted when we regrade your
assignments at the end of the quarter. Furthermore, fixing bugs in your modules now
will put you in a better place to earn the full system bonus at the end of the quarter.
The system bonus points are awarded for submitting a working system using entirely
your own code written for the assignments.
