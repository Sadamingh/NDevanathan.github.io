 * "consumed" the digit characters. A caller can pass NULL for `endptr`
 * if they do not need this information.

 * If `endptr` is not NULL, *endptr is updated to point to the character
 * in `str` where conversion stopped. This is either the address of the
 * first invalid character in `str` or the address of the terminating null
 * if all characters in `str` are valid digits.
