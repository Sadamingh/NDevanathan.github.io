/* These three functions from the printf family construct a
 * formatted output from an input format string and arguments.
 * All three functions accept format strings specified using the same
 * kind of conversions, but differ slightly in how the function is
 * called or what it does with the output string, e.g., whether it is
 * sent to the Raspberry Pi UART (printf) or written into the
 * client's buffer (snprintf, vsnprintf).
 *
 * The supported format conversions are
 *   %c    single character
 *   %s    string
 *   %d    signed decimal integer
 *   %x    unsigned hexadecimal integer (hex letters in lowercase)
 *   %p    pointer (printed as a hex address)
 *   %%    used to output a single percent character
 *
 * The %d and %x formats support an optional field width.
 *
 * The fancier printf features (padding with spaces, justification
 * left/right, precision, etc.) are not supported.
 * All format conversions other than the supported ones listed above
 * are considered invalid. The function's behavior for an invalid
 * format conversion is undefined.
