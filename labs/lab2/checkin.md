Check in with a TA during lab to validate your understanding of the answers to these questions.

1. Using the sample Makefile in the lab writeup, trace what happens when you issue `make` with no
   command-line arguments: what does `make` try to build? How does it
   determine what actions to take?

1. Got that "Green->success, Red->fail", but are there any other outcomes to watch for?  What happens when executing a test case that itself is in error, such as the final test case of `testing.c`? What happens if the bug in `count_bits` caused it to enter an infinite loop-- what then would you expect to be the observed behavior when testing?

1. Which pins must be connected to show `"3"` on the first digit? Which additional pins much be connected to show `"3333"` across all four digits? Why is it impossible to simultaneously show `"3"` on the first digit and `"4"` on the second? (The trick to doing so, as you will see in the assignment, is to quickly switch between digits to create the illusion of displaying `"34"`)
